# SAT Competition 2025: Call for Solvers and Benchmarks

The 2025 SAT Competition is a competitive event for solvers of the Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem. It is organized as a satellite event to the 28th International Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing and stands in the tradition of the annual SAT Competitions and Races. The registration deadline is April 30th, 2025 (23:59 GMT -12). More details will be available at the competition website https://satcompetition.github.io/2025/.

The area of SAT solving has seen tremendous progress over the last years. Many problems in applications such as hardware and software verification that seemed to be completely out of reach a decade ago can now be handled routinely. Besides new algorithms and better heuristics, refined implementation techniques turned out to be vital for this success.
To keep up the driving force in improving SAT solvers, we want to motivate developers to present their work to a broader audience and to compare it with that of others.

The 2025 SAT Competition will consist of the following tracks:

* Main Track (including the opportunity to choose from different proof checkers)

* Parallel Track


## New This Year

**New Infrastructure for the Main Track**

The SAT Competition 2025 will be hosted on the BenchCloud instance of the SoSy Lab in Munich for the first time. This results in changes to the submission and resource limits.
Details on the submission process will be provided on the competition website.

**New Organization Team**

We are happy to welcome Katalin Fazekas as a new member of the SAT Competition organization team.
We are sad to see Matti JÃ¤rvisalo and Martin Suda leave the organization team. We thank them for their great work during the past years.


## Aspects to Highlight

**Bring Your Own Benchmarks (BYOB)**

Each Main Track participant (team) is required to submit 20 new benchmark instances (not seen in previous competitions). At least 10 of those benchmarks should neither be too easy (solvable by MiniSat in a minute) or too hard (unsolvable by the participants own solver within one hour).

**PAR-2 Scoring Scheme**

The solvers will be ranked based on their penalized average runtime (PAR-2). The PAR-2 score of a solver is defined to be its average runtime over all instances, whereby unsolved instances contribute twice the time limit.


Best regards,
